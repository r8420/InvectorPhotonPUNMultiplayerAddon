The last version this plugin worked for is version 1.3.0 of invector. 

# InvectorPhotonPUNMultiplayerAddon
This is meant as a addon for the Unity Invector Package to add multiplayer support.

6. Open Invector/Multiplayer/Make Player Multiplayer Compatible
7. Follow the help box instructions
8. When done make the player multiplayer compatible run the Invector/Multiplayer/Convert Scene To Multiplayer
  - Note: This allows you to select which objects to modify. It is suggested to leave the tick box checked to avoid any problems.
9. Then run "Convert Prefabs To Multiplayer"
10. When done there run "(Optional) Setup Example UI"
11. Select the "Network Manager" Gameobject and delete "PUN_Lobby UI"
  - This is legacy code that I forgot to remove from the latest release. Easy enough to delete the component though :)
  
You're Done!

## Menu Options

### Convert Scene To Multiplayer
This will find all Invector components on gameobjects and Rigidbodies that can be made to correctly sync or work with multiplayer. 

### Add Multiplayer To Invector Scripts
This will modify the actual invector scripts to work with multiplayer.

### Create Network Manager
This creates the network manager gameobject. You don't really need to run this as the "Make Player Multiplayer Compatible" option will do the same thing.

### Make Player Multiplayer Compatible
This copies your gameobject, adds needed components, creates a network manager (with example UI), and setups up the PhotonView component with needed values. It also makes a prefab of this compatible player and assigns that player to the spawnable player for the network manager.

### Convert Prefabs To Multiplayer
This first scans your entire project for ALL prefabs. Then it filters the prefabs based on invector components that could be converted to work with multiplayer (PUN_* override versions). You select the prefabs you wish to update and it will apply the PUN override versions of the invector components and copy over all of the settings from the original component to the PUN override version.
